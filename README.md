# Food Tracker Lambda Function

A Lambda Function to serve as the backend of an application in which users can track the expiry dates of food items.

## Project Status

**Note: This is an experimental project and is not maintained or live.** This was created as an experiment whilst studying for my AWS Developer Exam. I wanted to see if I could create a full API using just AWS Lambda. It will not be put into production.

The current version of my food tracker project is using back end as a service (BaaS) for now during development.

## Architecture

The project demonstrates:
- AWS Lambda function handler
- API Gateway integration for HTTP requests
- Amazon DynamoDB for data persistence
- Amazon Cognito for authentication
